# Data-Visualization-with-Python#

This project used python to visualize a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014 of Anarbor city.

An NOAA dataset has been stored in the file `data/C2A2_data/BinnedCsvs_d400/fb441e62df2d58994928907a91895ec62c2c42e6cd075c2700843b89.csv`,
which comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) [Daily Global Historical Climatology Network](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt) (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.

Each row in the assignment datafile corresponds to a single observation.

The following variables are:

* **id** : station identification code
* **date** : date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2012-01-24 = January 24, 2012)
* **element** : indicator of element type
    * TMAX : Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
    * TMIN : Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
* **value** : data value for element (tenths of degrees C)
